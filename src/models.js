// real 3D models — the characters, props, architecture, creatures, furniture, spaceships, swords...

// A 3D model is a digital object made of geometry — think of it as a sculpture in code.

// It includes vertices, edges, faces, and sometimes animation or materials too.

// 3D artists usually create these in tools like Blender, Maya, or Cinema 4D.

// Then they export the result into file formats like:

// .obj – classic, simple mesh-only format
// .fbx – widely used, supports animation and rigging
// .dae – COLLADA format for data exchange
// .stl – common for 3D printing
// .3ds – legacy Autodesk format
// .gltf / .glb – modern, efficient, and web-friendly

// With pre-made models, you can:
// Add custom assets to your scene
// Reuse complex shapes like vehicles or characters
// Load assets from designers or asset stores
// Animate, rig, and interact
// Build scenes for games, visualizations, or films

// 🚀 The Most Popular Format: glTF / .glb
// We’ll use the .glb format — a compact binary version of glTF.

// Lightweight and fast-loading
// Supports materials, textures, lighting, animation
// Optimized for web apps, games, and mobile

// It’s called the “JPEG of 3D” — efficient, portable, and modern.
