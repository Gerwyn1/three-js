// mesh: most common 3d object: eg. cubes
// points -> collection of small dots in 3d space: stars/particles

// line -> simple connection between points in 3d space
// draw shapes, grids or wireframes

// group -> collection of multiple objects
// transform many objects together

// sprite, a 3d object that always faces the camera (always visible)
// billboards, icons, particles etc in a scene

// lights and cameras are NOT 3d objects but rather separate entities or tools that influence how 3d objects are seen.

// All elements in three.js, extend "Object3D" properties.
// Common: position, rotation, scale

// All usually starts with a mesh:
// spinning cube,
// realistic game character
// simple 3D logo on a website
// complex animated character

// Mesh consists of:
// block of clay: geometry
// paint and polish: material

// Geometry: The points/vertices, edges, and surfaces of the shape.
// Material: Color, texture, and how it reacts to light.

// a cube has 8 vertices and 12 edges

// Material
// Set solid colors or gradients
// Apply image textures (like wood or metal)
// Control how light reflects or passes through

// Explore different types of geometries
// Customize materials for cooler effects
// How to animate meshes

// Meshes: Foundation of everything you're build in 3D
  // Geometry: Shape/Form & Structure
  // Material: Style/Look
