// DIFFUSE
// A diffuse map contains the color information of the texture. It defines what original color the texture will have at a certain position.

// SPECULAR
// A specularity map defines how strong the textured surface will “shine” at a certain position. Most render engines use this information to define the appearance of specular highlights.

// DISPLACEMENT
// Displacement maps are similar to bump but store height information and generates “real” depth by adding geometry when rendered.

// AMBIENT OCCLUSION
// Ambient occlusion is a method to approximate how bright light should be shining on any specific part of a surface. Place it on top of the Diffuse in Multiply mode in Photoshop.

// NORMAL
// The red, green, and blue channels of the image are used to control the direction of each pixel’s normal. Normal map simulates the direction the normal is facing as well as the height, giving a more realistic effect.

// Texture is the secret sauce that can transform a dull, monochromatic cube into a realistic brick wall, a grassy field, or even a futuristic sci-fi surface

// Texture is an image that gets wrapped around a 3D object to give it color, detail, and realism. Think of it like wrapping a gift: the object is the box, and the Texture is the wrapping paper.

// Textures can do so much more than just add color—they can define how light interacts with the surface, add fine details like bumps or scratches, and even create the illusion of depth.

// Without Textures, your 3D objects would look like they’re made of plastic or clay. Textures add realism and detail to your scenes. Here’s what they can do:

// Add Color and Patterns: A texture can turn a plain sphere into a globe or a cube into a crate.
// Simulate Surface Details: Bump maps and normal maps use textures to create the illusion of bumps, dents, or scratches without adding extra geometry.
// Control Reflectivity and Shine: Specular maps define how shiny or reflective a surface is.
// Create Transparency: Alpha maps can make parts of a texture transparent, like leaves on a tree.
